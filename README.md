# Elo-Rating-System-For-Soccer

* An Elo Rating, or simply Elo, is a rating system used to measure the relative skill levels of players or teams in games and sports.
* It was originally developed for chess by Arpad Elo but has been widely adopted in various sports, including soccer.
* The Elo rating system provides a numerical representation of a player's or team's skill, making it easier to compare and rank them. 
* In soccer, Elo ratings can be applied to both club teams and national teams, offering a standardized way to evaluate and rank their performances.
* While other rating systems exist, Elo remains a popular choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness in capturing the competitive nature of the sport.
* In this project I show how to calculate a basic Elo rating for the sport and apply the method to the Bundesliga season 2015/16 using StatsBomb data.
* In the end we learn, that the rating itself does decent job in ranking teams only slightly differing from the actual final table in very little spots.
